# Trading-Strategy-Backtester
My first Python project, a trading strategy backtester which was used to test SMA crossover strategies with different paramaters on historical price data of US stocks. 

This was done as part of my Bachelor's Thesis and I used this opportunity to learn and practice building applications with Python. I wrote most of the functionality by hand and refrained from using too many Python packages to see how much I can do myself. Therefore, optimization wasn't a priority :)

main.py - main python file

strategies.py - file contatining functions acting as the signal emitting strategies

tickers.xlsx - excel containing tickers of the top 100 biggest US companies

tickers2.xlsx - excel contatining tickers of the top 50 biggest US companies, which have had negative return over the last 10 years

*Results and tickers files were obtained in ~June,2023
